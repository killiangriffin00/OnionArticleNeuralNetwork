# OnionArticleNeuralNetwork

Our team intends to apply convolutional neural networks to the field of text analysis. We will be evaluating if a machine learning algorithm can differentiate between articles that are written by the satirical news site "The Onion" and articles that individuals believe sound like they could come from the site, but are in fact real articles. We have a dataset consisting of headlines of articles, and a target feature specifying if the article is real or not. We intend to sanitize headline features and prepare them similar to how naive bayes classifiers have been prepared in class. Our end goal is to have an algorithm, as well as a direct demo where you can compete against the CNN for who can identify articles more accurately. 

Our team is composed of Trevor Naze, Ethan Nelson, and Killian Griffin. Killian will be working on researching how to apply CNNs to text processing and preparing the data, Ethan will be working on the actual implementation, and Trevor will be working on documentation for our final report, as well as implementation of the interactive demo. We plan to have research and data preperation completed within two weeks, building the algorithm and training the week after, and finally the implementation and documentation done the final week before presentation.
